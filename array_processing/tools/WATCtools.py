Provides
    1. Array processing methods applicable to geophysical time series
    2. Parameter estimation tools
    3. Support functions for digital signal processing

How to use the module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Documentation is available in docstrings provided with the code. The
docstring examples assume that `WATCtools` has been imported as `watc`::

    >>> help(watc.bpf)

Each of the module's methods may be called as::

    >>> watc.bpf(data, filt_band)

or imported individually and called as::

    >>> from WATCtools import bpf
    >>> bpf(data, filt_band)

def MCCMcalc(cmax, wgt=None):
    r"""
    Weighted mean (and median) of the cross-correlation maxima of wlsqva

    This method calculates `MCCM` as the weighted arithmetic mean of the cross-
    correlation maxima output of `wlsqva`, such that channels given a weight
    identical to zero are excluded from the `MCCM` calculation.  Optionally, it
    will calculate `MdCCM` as the weighted median of same.

    Parameters
    ~~~~~~~~~~
    cmax : array
           (n(n-1)//2, ) cross-correlation maxima for `n` channels of data and
           each channel pairing in `tau` (output of `wlsqva`)
    wgt : array
           (n, ) weights corresponding each of the `n` data channels (input to
           `wlsqva`). Default is an array of ones (all channels equally
           weighted and included).

    Returns
    ~~~~~~~
    MCCM : float
           Weighted arithmetic mean of the cross-correlation maxima
    MdCCM : float
           Weighted median of the cross-correlation maxima

    Notes
    ~~~~~
    A typical use of the weights in `wlsqva` is a simple binary scheme (i.e.,
    zeros to exclude channels & ones to include).  If both `cmax` and `wgt`
    are passed to `MCCMcalc`, then the unweighted channels will not
    contribute to the value `MCCM`.  If, however, only `cmax` is passed in such
    a case, the value of `MCCM` will be lower than expected.  This is since
    `wlsqva` sets identically to zero any `cmax` element corresponding to a
    pairing with an unweighted channel.  If `wgt` was passed to `wlsqva`, use
    it in this method, too, in order to ensure the expected numerical behavior
    of `MCCM`.  Non-binary weights in `wgt` will be used to calculate the
    traditionally-defined, weighted arithmetic mean of `cmax`.

    In the calculation of `MdCCM`, the weights are converted to binary -- i.e,
    channels are simply either included or excluded.

    Colored noise generator

    This function generates pseudo-random colored noise (power spectrum
    proportional to a power of frequency) via fast Fourier inversion of
    the appropriate amplitudes and complex phases.

    Parameters
    ~~~~~~~~~~
    N : int or tuple of int
        Shape of output array
    beta : float, optional
        Spectrum of output will be proportional to ``f**(-beta)``.
        Default is 0.0.

    Returns
    ~~~~~~~
    out : array
        Colored noise sequences as columns with shape `N`, each normalized
        to zero-mean and unit-variance.  Result is always real valued.

    See Also
    ~~~~~~~~
    ift : from `Z.py`, Sentman-like normalization of ifft
    numpy.fft : master fft functions

    Notes
    ~~~~~
    Spectrum of output will be :math:`\sim 1/f^\beta`.

    White noise is the default (:math:`\beta` = 0); others as pink
    (:math:`\beta` = 1) or brown/surf (:math:`\beta` = 2), ....

    Since the output is zero-mean, the DC spectral component(s) will
    be identically zero.
