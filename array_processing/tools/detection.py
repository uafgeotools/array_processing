def MCCMcalc(cmax, wgt=None):
    r"""
    Weighted mean (and median) of the cross-correlation maxima of
    :func:`~array_processing.algorithms.wlsqva.wlsqva`. This method
    calculates MCCM as the weighted arithmetic mean of the cross-
    correlation maxima output of
    :func:`~array_processing.algorithms.wlsqva.wlsqva`, such that channels
    given a weight identical to zero are excluded from the MCCM calculation.
    Optionally, it will calculate MdCCM as the weighted median of same.

    Args:
        cmax: ``(n(n-1)//2, )`` array; cross-correlation maxima for ``n``
            channels of data and each channel pairing in `tau` (output of
            :func:`~array_processing.algorithms.wlsqva.wlsqva`)
        wgt: ``(n, )`` array; weights corresponding each of the ``n`` data
            channels (input to
            :func:`~array_processing.algorithms.wlsqva.wlsqva`). Default is an
            array of ones (all channels equally weighted and included)

    Returns:
        tuple: Tuple containing:

        - **MCCM** – Weighted arithmetic mean of the cross-correlation maxima
        - **MdCCM** – Weighted median of the cross-correlation maxima

    Notes:
        A typical use of the weights in
        :func:`~array_processing.algorithms.wlsqva.wlsqva` is a simple binary
        scheme (i.e., zeros to exclude channels & ones to include). If both
        `cmax` and `wgt` are passed to this function, then the unweighted
        channels will not contribute to the value `MCCM`. If, however, only
        `cmax` is passed in such a case, the value of `MCCM` will be lower
        than expected. This is since
        :func:`~array_processing.algorithms.wlsqva.wlsqva` sets identically to
        zero any `cmax` element corresponding to a pairing with an
        unweighted channel. If `wgt` was passed to
        :func:`~array_processing.algorithms.wlsqva.wlsqva`, use it in this
        method, too, in order to ensure the expected numerical behavior of
        `MCCM`. Non-binary weights in `wgt` will be used to calculate the
        traditionally-defined, weighted arithmetic mean of `cmax`.

        In the calculation of `MdCCM`, the weights are converted to binary —
        i.e, channels are simply either included or excluded.
